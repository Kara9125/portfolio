        <h2>About</h2>
          <p> lil b loves you. He is an American rapper, record producer, author and motivational speaker from Berkeley, California. His hip-hop work in particular is often described as "based", a term also used to describe a lifestyle of positivity and tolerance. He is noted for his extensive use of social media websites such as MySpace and Twitter to build an online following. In 2011, NBA superstar Kevin Durant tweeted his befuddlement with Lil B's popularity, and Lil B responded by "cursing" Durant that he would never win the NBA championship. During the Western Conference Finals of the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Lil B began questioning NBA superstar James Harden's "cooking dance", who has been doing that dance all season long, and tweeted that if he doesn't receive an answer from Harden regarding that dance then Harden will receive the "Based God curse" similar to Kevin Durant. On May 24, 2015, Lil B announced on TMZ Sports that he has placed Harden under the "Based God curse" for the remainder of the playoffs and further notice. On May 27, 2015, Lil B was present at Oracle Arena for Game 5 where the Warriors ultimately defeated the Rockets with the score of 104â€“90 and become the Western Conference champions.Additionally, during this same game Harden set an NBA Playoff record with 13 turnovers, prompting Lil B to publicly consider lifting the curse. Thanks to Based God, the Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship in 40 years.</p>
